# whack-a-mole
Hi There

This is a vanilla javascript game for *1-player* and the mole will show on one of the nine box on screen and all you need to do is to click on the mole before the times go up (*all you've is 60 sceonds*).

If you've any ideas to make this better please create issue on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rajatgupta24/whack-a-mole).

Thank You
